# Demon's Crest — Native Fan Game

A native C11 + raylib foundation for a Demon's Crest fan game. The original
game is used as the reference: level/object data and graphics are extracted
from the player's own ROM, and the recompilation project is used as a
frame-accurate oracle for movement and timing.

> **No ROM data is distributed with this project.** The `assets/generated/`
> and `captures/` directories are git-ignored. You must own Demon's Crest
> (USA) and generate them locally.

**Full project state, recovered technical details, traps and next steps:
[`docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`](docs/PROJECT_STATE.md).**

**Full-campaign gap analysis and remaining work:
[`docs/FULL_CAMPAIGN_PLAN.md`](docs/FULL_CAMPAIGN_PLAN.md).**

## Current state

- 256×224 render target, integer-scaled, 60 Hz update.
- Extracted full graveyard starting room from ROM **Area 1** (`screens 8, 9` =
  bottom-row `slots 9, 10`), 2048×256 px across the populated 8-screen row,
  with the stone pillar (`cx=24`, `x=384..399`, `y=128..159`) beneath the urn
  at `(385, 111)`.
- BG1 comes from the ROM block tables for all eight screens; BG2 is the
  captured 64×32 forest backdrop and loops horizontally as the camera scrolls.
- Slope surface heights decoded from the `$80:962B` jump table: Firebrand
  walks up/down the `0x07..0x0e` hill, stands at `y=164` on `attr=0x09`, and
  the camera follows across the full room with horizontal and vertical
  deadzones.
- Player and item sprites extracted from OAM.
- Walk, jump, hover and fall driven by the authentic Bank `$80` state machine
  in 8.8 fixed point, with slope-aware floor collision and viewport bounds.
  `B + Up` flight is a debug-only extra (`DC_FLY_DEBUG=1`).
- Firebrand animation set extracted from `save0` (ROM Area 3, `screens 52, 53`):
  idle, 6-pose walk cycle, jump rise, hover/fly, fall, landing, 17-frame Y
  fireball spit and 31-frame A spell.
- Bank `$80` (`$80:DB00..F310`) player state machine and constants ported:
  - walk speed `$1020`: flat ground keeps the `0x0166` cap (1.398 px/frame);
    the `0x00B3` first step and `$80:8B85` ramp belong to the `$1070` terrain
    path and are not wired to the new slope surface table yet,
  - jump initial velocity `$1022 = 0x059C` (5.609 px/frame; `0x02CE`
    underwater), with immediate `vy = 0` cut on B release while rising
    (`$80:E227`),
  - gravity `$1026 = 0x0038` (0.21875 px/frame²; `0x002A` underwater), terminal
    fall `0xFA00` (-6.0 px/frame),
  - mid-air hover (`State 0x06` at `$80:E1A3` / `$80:E29F`): pressing B in air
    zeroes `$1022` (`vy = 0`) and bypasses gravity; pressing B again returns to
    falling (`State 0x04`). (`$85:C1D4` was identified as the dropped heart
    bounce routine, not player jump.)
- Fireball shot implemented end to end:
  - 7-slot projectile pool (`src/projectile.c`) matching `$1080..$1260`,
  - spawn on the Y press frame at `floor(player.x) + 3`,
    `floor(player.y) - 8` with velocity `0x0300` (3.0 px/frame),
  - palette-6 OAM stream baked as `fireball_0..8.png` + `fireball_anim.json`,
  - despawn on solid walls or camera viewport exit, mirrored for left shots.
- Object system (`src/object.c`, 26 slots) driven by the Area 1 `$81:C874`
  object list:
  - four destructible urns (`species $57`) at the listed positions,
  - fireball hits shatter urns and drop a heart with the `$85:C180` arc
    (4.0 px/frame pop-up, 0.25 gravity, decreasing bounces),
  - touching a heart increments HP up to max,
  - first-pass `species $67` ghouls emerge, chase, damage on contact with
    knockback and drop hearts when killed by fireballs.
- BG3 HUD extracted from `save0`: six-point health bar plus three crest slots
  at the top of the frame; the active spell slot is highlighted.
- Fixed 60 Hz simulation with a frame-time accumulator; presentation refresh
  is decoupled while `DC_RUN_FRAMES` remains deterministic.
- Player/fireball animation frames have pre-baked mirrored textures, so the
  renderer no longer uses negative source rectangles.
- `ctest` / `tools/run_regression.sh` runs deterministic demos and asserts
  physics, projectile, pickup, enemy and HP invariants.
- Original procedural audio: a looping chiptune theme plus jump, land, shoot,
  break, pickup, hurt and enemy-hit SFX (no ROM audio data).
- Vertical-slice flow: title screen, pause overlay, and an Area Clear trigger
  at the graveyard exit (`species $09` at `x=1920`).
- Full-campaign foundation:
  - native ROM CHR decompressor (`$80:C2AF`/`$80:C300`) and `$98:C000`/
    `$98:D000` table decoders;
  - all 113 valid ROM areas extracted to `room_area<N>.json` with 2D
    multi-row/vertical grids, collision, spawns, transitions and object lists;
  - per-area BG atlases baked from ROM CHR/palettes and swapped per room;
  - OAM metasprite decoder (`$8B:8000`) with real ROM item/Crest and ghoul
    sprites;
  - BG2 HDMA scanline parallax from `$84:AF65` for Area 1;
  - per-area BG2 backdrops from oracle frames: `tools/dc_extract/bg2_captures.json`
    maps an area to a `capture_anim.py` frame; the extractor bakes that frame's
    BG2 tilemap plus a capture-based atlas (Area 1 and Area 3 are baked today).
    The guest generates BG2 tilemaps at runtime (`$84:A057` DMAs them from WRAM
    `$7F`), so this is the interim path until the generator is decoded;
  - multi-room transitions, boss gates and boss fights (Area 0 Somulo);
  - six Gargoyle forms with Earth dash, Air flight, Water swim, Time/Ultimate
    defense, Fire-Crest elements, wall cling and headbutt;
  - skeleton/bat/gargoyle enemies, moving platforms, crest/Life-Stone pickups,
    gold, hazards, water and breakable terrain;
  - Crest/Item subscreen (`Tab`), shop, password/options/game-over/ending
    screens and a Mode 7-style overworld with six landing nodes.
- `tools/audit_campaign.py` reports per-room structure (BG1/collision coverage,
  BG2 presence, spawn support, object/transition bounds) and classifies rooms as
  playable / partial / empty; `--strict` is suitable for CI.
- Save/options persistence: campaign progression (area, cleared stages, HP,
  Crests/forms, Talismans, Urns, Spells, gold) and the music volume are written
  to `saves/dc_save.json` on area clear, overworld entry and exit. When a save
  exists the title menu gains a `CONTINUE` entry (and `DC_RESUME=1` resumes for
  headless tests). `DC_SAVE_PATH`, `DC_NO_SAVE` and `DC_SAVE_FORCE` control it;
  deterministic `DC_RUN_FRAMES` runs never touch the disk.
- HUD health bar uses the extracted mask with dark/red tints (missing health is
  dark, current HP is red) instead of the previous flat white bar.
- Native password system: 10 letters carry stages, max HP, Crests/form, Urns,
  Spells and Talismans plus an 8-bit checksum, with an interactive entry screen
  (up/down letter, left/right move, Enter applies, invalid codes rejected).
  `DC_PASSWORD=<code>` applies a code at boot and `DC_PASSWORD_SELFTEST=1`
  runs 2000 round-trips for CI. The retail algorithm is still unknown.
- Per-species enemy sprites: `tools/oracle/capture_species.py` injects a minimal
  object record so the guest initialises and draws a chosen species in the
  current room (no area travel), and `tools/dc_extract/extract_species.py` bakes
  the object's OAM cluster into `enemy_<species>_<n>.png` + `species_anim.json`.
  The engine draws those sheets per species, falling back to the shared sheet
  for species whose init expects spawner-supplied fields.
- Windows build on the raylib Windows installer (`tools/build_windows.ps1`,
  `-DDC_RAYLIB_ROOT`), verified with raylib 6.2 + MinGW GCC 16.2.
- Campaign-specific debug hooks: `DC_AREA`, `DC_CAMPAIGN`, `DC_BOSS_DEFEATED`,
  `DC_BOSS_HP`, `DC_STATE`, `DC_NO_HDMA`, `DC_UNDERWATER`.
- Saved-state validation from `save0` (normal graveyard gameplay):
  - walk speed measured 1.40 px/frame,
  - default SNES bindings (`$80:DB00` via `$1E3A..$1E4C`): **B = Jump/Hover**,
    **Y = Fireball shot** (spawns in `$1080..$1260` via `$80:F222`), **A =
    Talisman/Headbutt** (`State 0x16` / `0x1A`), **X = Subscreen**,
  - B tap is an ~11 px / 14-frame hop; holding B gives the full jump arc,
  - 603-frame `DC_DEMO=6` replay (validated before the full-room terrain
    change): max delta `x=0.00 px`, `y=0.53 px`.
- Debug collision overlay (`F1` or `DC_DEBUG_COLLISION=1`), FPS (`F3`).

This is a playable campaign foundation, not a finished game. The next milestone
is content fidelity: per-species OAM/AI, BG2/mid-stage CHR, text/cutscenes,
exact password/save and ROM audio.

### Current limitations

- All 113 areas load, but only Areas 1 and 3 have a BG2 backdrop so far; the
  remaining areas stay transparent until a capture frame is added to
  `tools/dc_extract/bg2_captures.json` (the BG2 layer is generated by the guest
  at runtime, not stored in the ROM block tables).
- BG2 parallax now uses the recovered `$84:AF65` HDMA bands in Area 1; other
  areas still need their own scanline tables.
- Six Gargoyle forms are implemented with movement/abilities and palette tints,
  but real per-form OAM sheets and animations are still needed.
- Per-species enemy AI and sprites are first-pass; skeletons, bats and
  gargoyles reuse the shared ghoul sheet until their `$82:8300` handlers are
  baked.
- The `$1070` probe is wired (`attr & 0xE0 == 0x80`) and selects the
  `0x00B3 → 0x0166` ramp, but exact per-shape oracle comparison remains.
- Hurt/death player animations and the real species `$67` handler
  (`$83:AF74`) are still to be ported; the current ghoul is a first-pass
  chase/damage/drop implementation using the real ghoul metasprite. HUD icons
  and per-species sprites remain approximations.
- No audio from the original ROM yet; the current music/SFX are original
  procedural development placeholders.
- Text/dialogue/cutscenes and the exact retail password algorithm are stubs;
  the clear/password/ending screens are functional but minimal, and the
  password codec is a native checksummed format rather than the retail code.
  Native save persistence (above) is in place, but it is not the retail SRAM
  format.
- The HUD health bar is scaled from the extracted six-point bar and highlights
  the active Crest form; the exact retail talisman-slot icons are not done.

## Requirements

- CMake 3.20+
- A C11 compiler
- Python 3 with Pillow
- Demon's Crest (USA), SHA-256
  `18d40a807d5f88c5b6a1ad849eec7e0f189225d9a1586037c850f6680b5844de`

- raylib is fetched automatically at configure time. Set `-DDC_RAYLIB_ROOT` to
  use a local raylib install instead (required for the offline Windows build).
  On Fedora the desktop build also needs the X11/GL development headers:

```sh
sudo dnf install libXrandr-devel libXinerama-devel libXcursor-devel \
  libXi-devel libX11-devel mesa-libGL-devel alsa-lib-devel
```

## 1. Capture a reference frame

Use the recompilation project's trace build. The `gameplay.script` route reaches
the first playable area at frame 43659 and dumps the machine 600 frames later.

```sh
RECOMP_DIR=/path/to/DemonsCrestSNESRecomp \
ROM="/path/to/Demon's Crest (USA).sfc" \
./tools/capture_graveyard.sh
```

Or run it by hand:

```sh
cd /path/to/DemonsCrestSNESRecomp
SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy SDL_AUDIODRIVER=dummy \
SNESRECOMP_DUMP_DIR=/path/to/DemonsCrestNativePort/captures/graveyard \
./build-trace/DemonsCrestSNESRecomp "/path/to/Demon's Crest (USA).sfc" \
  --script scripts/routes/gameplay.script
```

Copy/rename the four files the extractor needs:

```text
captures/graveyard/stage_600.vram.bin
captures/graveyard/stage_600.cgram.bin
captures/graveyard/stage_600.oam.bin
captures/graveyard/stage_600.regs.json
```

The `dump` command writes the framebuffer too; it is useful for visual
comparison but the extractor does not need it.

## 2. Extract assets

```sh
python3 tools/dc_extract/extract.py \
  --rom "/path/to/Demon's Crest (USA).sfc" \
  --dump captures/graveyard \
  --prefix stage_600 \
  --area 1 \
  --screens 9,10 \
  --full-room \
  --out assets/generated
```

`--full-room` builds every screen in the captured 8-screen row (2048×256 px
for Area 1) from the ROM block tables; omit it for the old two-screen
256×224 viewport slice.

Per-area BG2 backdrops come from an optional manifest,
`tools/dc_extract/bg2_captures.json`:

```json
{"areas": {"3": {"dir": "captures/anim", "frame": 20614}}}
```

Each entry points at a `capture_anim.py` frame (its `.json` + `.vram.bin`).
The extractor copies that frame's BG2 tilemap into the room document, keeps the
original BG2-vs-BG1 scroll offset, and bakes the area's BG atlases from the
capture's VRAM/CGRAM so streamed tiles are covered. Use `--bg2-map <path>` to
point at another manifest, or `--bg2-map` at an empty file to disable it.

Outputs:

- `room.json` — full-row BG1 tilemap, looping BG2 backdrop, slope collision
  grid, spawn, camera/play bounds.
- `room_area<N>.json` — one 2D room document per valid ROM area (113 areas),
  with spawns, transitions, boss gate and object list.
- `bg_area<N>_pal<P>.png` — per-area BG atlases baked from ROM CHR/palettes
  (palettes used by that area only).
- `bg_pal0..7.png` — 4bpp BG tile atlases for the captured Area 1 frame.
- `obj_pal0..7.png` — 4bpp OBJ tile atlases.
- `player_idle.png` — Firebrand composed from OAM.
- `item_00.png` — the visible item composed from OAM.
- `heart_00..01.png` / `enemy_00..01.png` — real ROM metasprite item and ghoul.
- `campaign.json` — area list, Gargoyle palettes and Area 1 HDMA bands.
- `manifest.json` — ROM identity and capture provenance.

A full extractor run writes about 57 MB and takes roughly a minute. The
generated directory is git-ignored and never distributed.

## 2b. Capture and extract Firebrand animations

The trace build exposes a 6000-frame per-frame state ring plus a TCP debug
server. `capture_anim.py` starts it paused, resumes a copy of `save0.sav`, and
drives absolute frame targets with held buttons. It then saves OAM, CGRAM,
registers and VRAM for each frame.

```sh
python3 tools/oracle/capture_anim.py \
  --recomp /path/to/DemonsCrestSNESRecomp \
  --rom "/path/to/Demon's Crest (USA).sfc" \
  --save /path/to/DemonsCrestSNESRecomp/saves/save0.sav \
  --out captures/anim

python3 tools/dc_extract/extract_anim.py \
  --dump captures/anim \
  --out assets/generated \
  --clean
```

This writes `player_idle_0.png`, `player_walk_0..5.png`,
`player_jump_0..2.png`, `player_hover_0.png`, `player_fall_0..1.png`,
`player_land_0..1.png`, `player_attack_0..2.png`, `player_spell_0..2.png`,
`fireball_0..8.png`, `hud_bar.png`, `hud_slots.png`, `player_anim.json` and
`fireball_anim.json`. The real item/Crest and ghoul PNGs
(`heart_00..01.png`, `enemy_00..01.png`) are baked by `extract.py` from ROM
CHR/OAM.
The engine falls back to `player_idle.png` if the player JSON is absent, and
skips the HUD if `hud_bar.png`/`hud_slots.png` are absent.

## 2c. Validate Step 3 movement against `save0`

```sh
python3 tools/oracle/capture_anim.py \
  --recomp /path/to/DemonsCrestSNESRecomp \
  --rom "/path/to/Demon's Crest (USA).sfc" \
  --save /path/to/DemonsCrestSNESRecomp/saves/save0.sav \
  --segments tools/oracle/segments_save0_physics.json \
  --out captures/phys

python3 tools/oracle/export_capture_csv.py captures/phys -o /tmp/oracle_phys.csv

DC_DEMO=6 DC_RUN_FRAMES=603 DC_TRACE_CSV=/tmp/native_demo6.csv \
  ./build/demonscrest   # xvfb-run -a when headless

python3 tools/oracle/compare.py /tmp/native_demo6.csv /tmp/oracle_phys.csv \
  --oracle-start 0 --threshold 1.0
```

Expected: 603 frames compared, max delta `x=0.00 px`, `y=0.53 px`.

## 3. Build and run

Linux/macOS (raylib fetched by CMake):

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j
./build/demonscrest
```

Windows (MinGW + the raylib Windows installer, offline):

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/build_windows.ps1
# or point CMake at any raylib tree with a prebuilt libraylib.a:
cmake -S . -B build -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DDC_RAYLIB_ROOT=C:\raylib\raylib
cmake --build build
build\demonscrest.exe --assets assets\generated
```

`-DDC_RAYLIB_ROOT` skips the `FetchContent` download and links the local
`libraylib.a`; the script defaults to `C:\raylib\raylib` and builds serially
because some Windows shells restrict the jobserver named pipe used by
make/ninja.

Use `--assets <dir>` to load assets from another directory.

```

### Regression test

After building and extracting assets:

```sh
./tools/run_regression.sh
# or
cd build && ctest --output-on-failure
```

The harness runs demos 6, 7, 9, 10, 11 and 12 through `DC_RUN_FRAMES`, writes trace
CSVs, and asserts known movement, fireball, pickup, enemy, HP, Crest-form and
campaign-transition invariants. It also checks save/options persistence: one run
autosaves (with `DC_SAVE_FORCE`), a second run resumes it and the trace must
report the same area, max HP and gold. The password codec is exercised twice:
the binary self-test, and a Python-generated code applied via `DC_PASSWORD`
must restore max HP and form.
It exits with code 77 (CTest skip) when the binary or generated assets are
missing.

### Campaign audit

`tools/audit_campaign.py` checks every generated room document without running
the game: world/collision/BG dimensions, BG1 and collision coverage, BG2
presence, spawn support, object bounds and transition/gate targets. Rooms are
classified as `playable`, `partial` or `empty`.

```sh
python3 tools/audit_campaign.py
python3 tools/audit_campaign.py --strict --json /tmp/campaign_audit.json
```

`--strict` exits non-zero when a playable room breaks a structural invariant, so
it can gate CI alongside the regression suite.
