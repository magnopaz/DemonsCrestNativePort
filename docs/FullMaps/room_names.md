# Named rooms from the level saves

Built by `tools/dc_extract/build_room_names.py` from saves named
`lvl_<level>_<map-name>[_role]`. Each row is an area id observed in a save
plus the map it corresponds to.

## What the mismatch means

The player coordinates in the saves fit inside the map dimensions but often
fall outside our extracted world (thorn grove: save x=909 vs our 512 px;
underground dyke: x=1687 vs our 512 px). The ROM grid table
(`$81:A6D8`, read by `area_info`) reports 2x2 for those areas, while the
community maps show 5x3 and 7x3 — and the maps agree with the save
coordinates. So the grid table does **not** describe the full room for
multi-screen areas; the room is a chain/stream of more screen data than that
table holds.

Consequence for M1: room extents must come from the maps (and runtime
observation), not from the static grid table. The next extraction step is to
compose rooms from the map-driven screen lists instead of `area_info`.
